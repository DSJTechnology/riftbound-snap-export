# Task Completion Checklist
- Run `npm run lint` to catch TS/React issues.
- Build with `npm run build` (or `npm run build:dev` for dev mode) to verify bundling.
- Use `npm run preview` to spot-check the built app if needed.
- No automated tests documented yet; validate manually or add tests if required.
